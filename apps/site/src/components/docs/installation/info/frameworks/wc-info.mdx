Our [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) library can
be used anywhere with the simple drop of an import or CDN link as they're natively supported by
all browsers. This option is best when writing plain HTML or using a JS library that supports
them. Custom Elements have [perfect support in most libraries](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com).
