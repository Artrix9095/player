The [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) option provides you with a minimal starting point and
completely unstyled components. All components including the player itself provide styling hooks via
data attributes and support animations. Our [optional plugin](/docs/player/styling/tailwind) can
help speed you up even more by providing you with easy to use media variants such as
`media-paused:opacity-0`.
