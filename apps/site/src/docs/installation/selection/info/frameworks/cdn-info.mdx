Using the [JSDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com) is the simplest and fastest way to start using
the player library via [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components).
We provide a CDN bundle that includes all package dependencies, and it's specially minified to get
the bundle size as small as possible. Add a few `<script>` and `<style>` tags to your `<head>` element
and you're ready to start building!
