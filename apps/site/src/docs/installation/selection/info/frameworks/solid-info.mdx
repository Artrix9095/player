We don't have a specific integration for [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com) at the moment. However, you
can enjoy all Vidstack Player features through our
[Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) library
as [Solid has perfect support](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/#solid).

We also ship JSX types to make sure you have complete TypeScript support for props and events!
