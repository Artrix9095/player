## Usage

The Default Layout ships with support for audio and video. You can include both layouts at the
same time, only one will be matched depending on the view type.

::code[./usage]

By default, the view type is inferred from the provider and media type. You can specify the desired
type like so:

::code[./view-type]

## Size

Both the audio and video layout will adapt to small containers to ensure an optimal user experience.
You configure when the small layout is displayed by using [Player Queries][player-queries]:

::code[./sm-layout]

If you'd like to disable small layouts, set the query to `false` or `'never'`:

::code[./disable-sm-layout]

[player-queries]: /docs/player/styling/responsive-design#player-queries

::code[./icons]{copy=true}

::code[./provide-icons]
