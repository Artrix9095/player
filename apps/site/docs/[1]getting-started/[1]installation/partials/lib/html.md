The `HTML` option refers to our [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
library. Our custom elements can be used anywhere with the simple drop of an import or CDN link as
they're natively supported by browsers. This option is best when writing plain HTML or using a
JS library such as [Angular](https://angularjs.org). Native web components have
[excellent support](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com) in most libraries.
