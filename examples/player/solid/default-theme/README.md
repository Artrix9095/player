# Player: Solid (Default Theme)

The Default Theme is best when you want to build your own player but you don't want to
design each component from zero. Our default styles have been built to be extremely easy to
customize! We provide the shell and base styles and you provide the content and customization.

This example demonstrates setting up and customizing the Default Theme using Vidstack Player
Web Components with Solid.
