# Player: Solid (CSS)

The CSS option provides you with a minimal starting point and completely unstyled components. All
components including the player itself provide styling hooks via data attributes and support
animations. This option is best when you want to build your player yourself from scratch using
vanilla CSS.

This example demonstrates setting up your custom layout with CSS using Vidstack Player
Web Components with Solid.
